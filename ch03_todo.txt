TODO:

- Abstract inode_alloc page allocation to storage.c
- Have files > 4k
  - write_node
  - only grow node when offset + size > node->size
  - manage direct and indirect pointers
	- if direct pointers are full: 
		if indirect pointer is 0: allocate new page for indirect pointer and alloc new page + idx entry in indirect pointer page
			AND grow file size by 4k because of indirect pointer. (maybe?)
        if indirect pointer exists: find new page index though old_num_pages+ii, go into indirect pointer, alloc page and add idx entry
